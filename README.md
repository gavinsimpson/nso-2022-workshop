## Pre-workshop setup

You'll need:

* Laptop
* R (preferably 4.2.0 or later, but 4.1.3 should be OK too)
* RStudio (latest version for your OS) If you want to use your own IDE for R that's fine, but we'll be working with RStudio and can't support attendees using other IDEs)
* Packages: Latest versions of tidyverse, mgcv, vegan, gratia installed.

To install the required packages and make sure their dependencies are up-to-date, please run

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "mgcv", "vegan", "gratia"))
```

prior to the workshop start.
